# SWH
Small-World Heuristic - a Full mesh network

## Introduction
The Small world Heuristic or SWH G(d,k) is a smart algorithm process to generate differents connected graphs.

* What is a graph? Graph or Network diagram show interconnections between a set of entities.
* What is an entity? entity is represented by a Node or vertice, e.g sensor.
* Connections between nodes are represented through links or edges or degree denoted (d).
* The -maximum distance- between two nodes is a Diameter denoted (k).
* What is a distance between two nodes? it is the length of longest shortest path.

## SWH criterias
According to some algorithm criterias, like a custom diameter calculation, nodes process generator and a smart input parameter:
* SWH generates new large vertex graphs with an out-degree and diameter.
* SWH can reach the Moore bound with some criteria.
* SWH generates mesh, torus and hypercube networks.
* SWH generates networks near to de Bruijn graph.


## Results 
With SWH graph, you can customise your graph in term of number of nodes, number of links and diameter.

SWH can reach the same/better characteristics of some largest known graphs and much faster:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_the_largest_known_graphs_of_a_given_diameter_and_maximal_degree.

* SWH(6,5) can reach 6000 nodes
* SWH(10,5) can reach 13200 nodes
* SWH(11,5) can reach 19520 nodes
* SWH(16,3) can reach 3800 nodes
* SWH (10,10) can reach over 2000 000 nodes
* SWH(15,10) can reach over 10 000 000 nodes

Some excellent results have been made by using an HPC computer.
