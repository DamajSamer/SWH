# SWH
Small-World Heuristic - a Full mesh network

The Small world Heuristic or SWH G(d,k) is a smart algorithm process to generate differents connected graphs.

* What is a graph? Graph or Network diagram show interconnections between a set of entities.
* What is an entity? entity is represented by a Node or vertice, e.g sensor.
* Connections between nodes are represented through links or edges or degree denoted (d).
* The -maximum distance- between two nodes is a Diameter denoted (k).
* What is a distance between two nodes? it is the length of longest shortest path.

According to some algorithm criteria:
* SWH generates new large vertex graphs with an out-degree and diameter.
* SWH can reach the Moore bound with some criteria.
* SWH generates mesh, torus and hypercube networks.
* SWH generates networks near to de Bruijn graph.
* SWH can reach the same/better characteristics of some largest known graphs,but the algo generates these graphs much faster:
