# SWH
Small-World Heuristic - a Full mesh network

## INTRODUCTION
The Small world Heuristic or SWH G(d,k) is a smart algorithm process to generate differents connected graphs.

* What is a graph? Graph or Network diagram show interconnections between a set of entities.
* What is an entity? entity is represented by a Node or vertice, e.g sensor.
* Connections between nodes are represented through links or edges or degree denoted (d).
* The -maximum distance- between two nodes is a Diameter denoted (k).
* What is a distance between two nodes? it is the length of longest shortest path.

## SWH CRITERIAS

According to an algorithm criterias, like a custom diameter calculation and nodes process generator, SWH(d,k) is a full mesh topology.
* small mesh graphs
* medium mesh graphs
* large mesh graphs
  
According to a smart input criteria, SWH(d,k) can change its characteristics and can reach:
* Torus and Hypercube networks
* de Bruijn graph

SWH can reach the Moore bound with specific criterias.

## RESULTS 
With SWH graph, you can customise your graph in term of number of nodes, number of links and diameter.

SWH can reach the same/better characteristics of some largest known graphs and much faster:

### Some SWH large graphs
* SWH(6,5) can reach 6000 nodes
* SWH(10,5) can reach 13200 nodes
* SWH(11,5) can reach 19520 nodes
* SWH(16,3) can reach 3800 nodes
* SWH (10,10) can reach over 2000 000 nodes
* SWH(15,10) can reach over 10 000 000 nodes

Some excellent results have been made by using an HPC computer.

### Some SWH mesh graphs
* SWH(63,1) reaches 64 nodes 
* SWH(255,2) reaches 256 nodes
* SWH(1023,2) reaches 1024 nodes
